## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Gradle build tool
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or another Java IDE

### Setting up a Practice Exercise

1. Navigate to the desired practice directory:
   ```bash
   cd PRATICAS/6/refactoring
   ```

2. Build the project with Gradle:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

## 📌 Key Projects

### Refactoring Exercises
- Implementation of various refactoring techniques including:
  - Extract Method
  - Move Method
  - Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
  - Encapsulate Field
  - Inline Method

### Design Patterns Implementation
- Examples of common design patterns:
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Singleton
  - Observer
  - Strategy
  - Composite

### Test-Driven Development
- Practice of writing tests before implementation
- Unit testing with JUnit
- Property-based testing
